# Machine-Learning-Understanding

## Each Python notebook is different in its own way and has its own significance. 

1. Basic UnderStanding of NumPy Modlue in Python. (Numpy_Basic,ipynb)</br>
Some Basic Functions that might be usefull to study data are implemented in this notebook. </br>

2. Implementation of Decision Tree Classifier. (Decision_Tree_Classifier.ipynb) </br>
Decision Tree is implemented on co2.csv dataset </br>
note -> Kindly download the notebook and run again to understand the flow of decision tree graphically.

3. Implementation of Linear And Multiple Regression. (Linear_And_Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb)</br>
    A) Data Cleaning. </br>
    B) Linear Regression. </br>
    C) Multiple Regression. </br>
  Dataset Used -> co2.csv </br>
  
  4. Implementation of Logistic Regression: (Logistic_Regression.ipynb) </br>
